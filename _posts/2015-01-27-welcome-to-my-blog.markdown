Hi, and welcome to my blog!

In this post, I will note the motivation for creating this blog, and a little about who I am.

In the [next post]({% post_url 2015-01-29-how-this-blog-was-made %}), I will go over the steps I followed to create this site.

#### Me: 
I have recently embarked on a journey to become a professional software developer. Currently, the majority of my expertise is in **data science** (statistics and finance, R and Excel / VBA). 

I am excited about expanding my knowledge in the visual and user experience (UX) aspects of design. I love to make things that are streamlined and elegant to the senses, while of course also providing great, error-free and efficient functionality under the hood.

So, this blog will be focused on issues related to **web development** as I progress in this journey.  I hope that what I share here might help others on a similar path.

####Motivation:

1. Learning better by writing / teaching:

    A great way to explore and cement new concepts in your mind is to explain them to someone else, even if that someone else is just a blank screen.

2. A resource for others:
  
    Some subjects can be very hard to wrap one's head around until you see/hear/read it explained in a certain way that just makes it seem so simple. After that, a wall is often broken down and one can then circle back to the previously unintelligible explanations with a very different mindset and vastly better understanding. 

    I have experienced this many times throughout my education, and greatly appreciate the ability to read ten different well-done explanations of the same topic which the web offers us. If I can offer a useful explanation of a concept to others that helps them achieve a breakthrough and saves them time and frustration, this blog will have served a great purpose.
