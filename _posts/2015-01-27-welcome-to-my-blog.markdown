Hi, and welcome to my blog!

In this post, I will note the motivation for creating this blog, and a little about who I am.

In the [next post]({% post_url 2015-01-29-how-this-blog-was-made %}), I will go over the steps I followed to create this site.

#### Me: 
I have recently embarked on a journey to become a professional software developer. Currently, the majority of my expertise is in **data science** (statistics and finance, R and Excel / VBA). 

I am excited about expanding my knowledge in the visual and user experience (UX) aspects of design. I love to make things that are streamlined and elegant to the senses, while of course also providing great, error-free and efficient functionality under the hood.

So, this blog will be focused on issues related to **web development** as I progress in this journey, and I hope that what I share here might help others on a similar path.

Many times throughout my life I have experienced a concept that I am really not able to wrap my head around, until I arrive to an explanation that is put in just a certain way that makes it seem so simple and easy.  After that, a wall is often broken down, and one can often return to previously unintelligible explanations with a huge boost in understanding. I would feel greatly honored to be able to return the many favors the web has bestowed upon me over the years by possibly providing an explanation that allows others to achieve a similar breakthrough moment.


Because of this, 

I feel it's a great honor, and one of the most brilliant opportunities the web provides, if I can return the favor and possibly provide a useful explanation to others that might help them achieve a similar breakthroughand save them time and frustration.

very different mindset and vastly better understanding. 

Because of this, I greatly appreciate the resource the web offers

to read many well-donw explanations of the same topic.

After that, a wall is often broken down and one can then circle back to the previously unintelligible explanations with a very different mindset and vastly better understanding.

Some subjects can be very hard to wrap one's head around until you see/hear/read it explained in a certain way that just makes it seem so simple. After that, a wall is often broken down and one can then circle back to the previously unintelligible explanations with a very different mindset and vastly better understanding. 

I have experienced this many times throughout my education, and greatly appreciate the ability to read ten different well-done explanations of the same topic which the web offers us. If I can offer a useful explanation of a concept to others that helps them achieve a breakthrough and saves them time and frustration, this blog will have served a great purpose.

Additionally, I imagine writing this blog will also help me, as writing and teaching a concept to others is a great way to explore and cement new concepts in your mind, even if that someone else is just a blank screen.



####Motivation:

1. Learning better by writing / teaching:

    A great way to explore and cement new concepts in your mind is to explain them to someone else, even if that someone else is just a blank screen.

2. A resource for others:
